# Neomorphism Project

The Neomorphism Project is a web project that demonstrates the creation of the popular neumorphic design effect using HTML and pure CSS. The project focuses on understanding and implementing the `box-shadow` property to achieve the neomorphic style.

## Features

- Learn and practice creating neomorphic designs using HTML and CSS.
- Explore the use of `box-shadow` property to achieve the soft and three-dimensional visual effect.
- Experiment with different color schemes, shapes, and components to create unique neomorphic designs.
- Understand the principles behind neomorphism, including light and shadow interactions.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/Bhawna-Vishwakarma/Neomorphism-Project.git


Open the project in your preferred web browser.

Navigate through the different HTML files to explore various neomorphic design examples.

Examine the CSS styles to understand how the box-shadow property is used to create the neomorphism effect.

Modify the code and experiment with different settings to create your own neomorphic designs.
